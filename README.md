## Pre-requisites
This guide assumes basic knowledge of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design in any PCB design software. We used EagleCAD in this guide but it should be the same for KiCAD. Altium users also have the luxury of skipping the steps of generating Gerber files.

You should also have a taobao account. 

While some knowledge of Chinese is useful, it is not necessary for the basic PCB designs in this guide.
